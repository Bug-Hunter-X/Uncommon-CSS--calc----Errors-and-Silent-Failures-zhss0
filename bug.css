The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use spaces around the plus or minus signs, it might not work as expected. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works, but `width: calc(100%  -  10px);` might not.  Another issue can arise when using `calc()` with units inconsistently. For instance, `height: calc(50% + 10em);` is valid, but mixing units without proper conversion can lead to unexpected results. Also, if a `calc()` expression contains an invalid expression or operation the CSS will simply ignore the entire declaration without throwing an error, leading to unexpected visual bugs.
